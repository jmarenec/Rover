A radio controlled rock crawler vehicle that was deconstructed to be remotely piloted through the internet. Vehicle is controlled via a web browser with video feed. Throttle and steering is controlled by the computer's mouse. Cell phone with touch screen can also be used to control the vehicle. Raspberry Pi 3 is configured to provide internet access and interfaces with an Arduino-Uno to deliver PWM signals to control steering and throttle.
